## ✨ What’s New in This Fixed Version
- ✅ **No more `GM_addStyle is not defined` error** — works across Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, Greasemonkey  
- 🎨 **Per-color toggle UI** — easily enable/disable specific pixel colors  
- 🖼️ **Template overlay only** — no automation, fully rules-compliant with Wplace  
- 🎯 **Click-to-autofill coordinates** — just click the canvas once, and fields auto-populate  
- ⚙️ **Persistent settings** — opacity, colors, and configs are remembered  
- 🔒 **Clean & safe** — no telemetry, no network calls, no auto-placement

## 🚀 Installation
1. Install a userscript manager:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)  
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)  
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)  

2. [Download the userscript](./Wplace_BlueMarble_Fixed.user.txt)  

3. Open it in your browser → your userscript manager will ask to install.  

4. Head over to [wplace.live](https://wplace.live) → upload a template → adjust opacity/coords → done! 🎉

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- 🐒 **Tampermonkey bug**: For some users, the script does **not auto-run when installed** via Tampermonkey.  
- ✅ **Workaround**: Copy the entire script and run it manually from the browser console (F12 → Console → paste → Enter).  
- This seems related to Tampermonkey’s injection timing on Wplace — still investigating.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- This script **only overlays templates**. It does **not** place pixels automatically.  
- Fully compliant with Wplace rules ✅  
- Perfect for organizing large artworks with your team.
